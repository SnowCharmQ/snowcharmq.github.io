          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there! I am Yilun Qiu, a Y1 master student at the National
            University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Computer Science
            (Specialisation).<br /><br />
            Driven by a passion for computer science, I pursued a bachelor's
            degree in Computer Science and Technology at the Southern University
            of Science and Technology. Throughout my studies, I gained
            proficiency in multiple programming languages, including Java,
            Python, and Kotlin, while also deepening my understanding of core
            computer science principles like data structures and algorithms,
            computer networks, and operating systems. These skills led to
            valuable internships at the Nankerixin Technology Co., Ltd. and Ruomai
            Medical Co., Ltd. in China, where I further honed my system
            architecture design and team communication abilities, gaining
            essential industry experience.<br /><br />
            Currently, I am advancing my expertise by pursuing a Master of
            Computing degree at the National University of Singapore, where I
            aim to deepen my understanding of computer science and apply this
            knowledge in real-world scenarios. Eager to embark on a career in
            software development, I am committed to leveraging my skills to
            tackle diverse challenges and contribute innovative solutions to the
            industry.
